# LL-parser-implementation
an LL-parser implementation for FOCS FA 23 final project.

We won't add a verbose README here, because there really isn't any additional context necessary to run this code:

1. run `python3 run.py` to see the entire syntactical analysis work on whatever input string you give it
2. run `python3 table.py` to see the ONLY the table construction happen
3. run `pytest test_run.py` to automatically test the code with a bunch of inputs

I suppose you'll need pytest to make this work fully.
